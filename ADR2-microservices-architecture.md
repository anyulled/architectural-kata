# ADR2.Use micro services architecture

## STATUS
Accepted

## DESCRIPTION
As the system needs elasticity working on cloud and the services themselves are independent of each other communicating between themselves in a coreographed manner and requiring several architecrual quality attributes, the micro services architecture showed itself as the one who give us the required ones.

## DECISION
As we need to have elasticity, scalability, high availability, the micro services architecture gave us all in one out of box.

## CONSEQUENCES
This architecture brings us some drawback, microservices architecture bring more complexity and also make us bear with network communication of the components in the system as well as observe what is going on through the services themselves.
